**CUCP: A Chinese User Comment Dataset Focused on Urban Parks**

ðŸ“Œ *Status: Under Review*

---

In this paper, we propose a Chinese user comment dataset focused on urban parks, named **CUCP**.

First, the dataset is sourced from popular Chinese review platforms: **Dianping**, **Ctrip**, and **Xiaohongshu**.  
Second, the reviews cover two aspects: **sentiment** and **sensory perception**. The sentiment reviews are classified as *positive* or *negative*, while the sensory reviews are categorized into **vision**, **touch**, **taste**, **smell**, and **hearing**.  
Third, our dataset contains **103,831** entries, which surpasses the dataset sizes of most related studies, reflecting its richness and diversity.  
Lastly, we fine-tuned several widely-used NLP models, including **BERT**, **RoBERTa**, **ELECTRA**, and **XLNet**. The experimental results show that for both sentiment and sensory classification tasks, the models achieve **accuracy, precision, recall, and F1 scores all above 90%**, indicating the high quality and utility of the CUCP dataset.
